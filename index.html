            				<h1>AIMS</h1>
            				<p>Pets are an important part of your family but they need their own space, which is why they often disappear in a few minutes, a few hours or even a few days. Instead of worrying and not knowing where to find them, you only need a GPS device and Petracker application to know their location and how far you are. Real time tracking, alerts, and reports from the palm of your hand.</p>

            				<p>For everyone, especially with pet owners. With GPS technology,  colorful and stylish designs, the Petracker application will help you determine your pooch’s location even when you’re far from home.</p>

            			<p>The cool tone is chosen for the entire application includes baby blue, dark blue and light grey. The baby blue is the main color which was applied in the header and main area. White is used for large informative textual elements for contributing the minimalist design.</p>

                        <p>Sans serif fonts were used because the near-uniform width of the strokes keeps the font readable when reduced in resolution or reduced in font size. San Francisco family font is selected for the entire application because of the variety in styles (18 styles) and modern design.</p>

            				<p>Global Positioning System (GPS) & GSM – For a GPS Tracker to work, it requires GPS and GSM(Cellphone coverage) signals much like a Smartphone does to get it's location on Google Map. So think of a GPS tracker as a smartphone for your pet, where if a smartphone works, so will the tracker. This also means each tracker requires it's own SIM card like a phone.</p>

            				<p>Petracker aims to be simple, user-friendly, and highly customisable. This mockup is intended to give you an idea of what the interface might be like. It is interactive, and certain parts will allow you to navigate the application in its initial form.</p>
